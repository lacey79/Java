# Puss-In-Boots-Maze
I wrote solutions (conditionals) to help a cat navigate a simple maze.

My solution was tested against each of the 20 sample mazes. The 20 sample mazes correspond to the mazex-y.txt files in the zip file, where x is [1, 4] and y is [1, 5]. I debugged your solution by running the GUI on the different mazes.

For each maze, my solution solved the maze in less than 1,000,000 steps.
